<summary><strong>Secure Boot (Optional)</strong></summary>
<br>

1. Set Secure Boot to Setup Mode. Secure Boot should be reported as off by UEFI main tab
2. Create FAT32 formatted USB
3. Create EFI folder in the root of the newly formatted flash drive and move there content of SecureBoot/KeyTool
4. Boot flash drive via F12 boot menu
5. Choose **Edit keys**

6. Start by **replacing** Signature Database. Select .auth file


<img src="./Other/README_Resources/SecureBoot/ManipulateKey.png" alt="Select key to manipulate with">
<img src="./Other/README_Resources/SecureBoot/SelectAuth.png" alt="Select .auth file">


7. Do the same for Key Exchange Keys Database (KEK) and Platform Key (PK) **in this order**
8. Exit and shutdown your machine
9. Boot into the UEFI settings and check if Secure Boot is reported as `on`
10. Boot you favorite OS with Secure Boot enabled

## Post-Install

<details>  

<summary><strong>Colour banding</strong></summary>
<br>

If you encounter some serious colour banding issues ( Keep in mind that T480 1080p stock panel colour accuracy is not really good, cca 50-60% sRGB), your only solution is to replace GPU properties as bellow or replace the stock panel with one from T490 (400 nits, Low power).

```
<key>AAPL,ig-platform-id</key>
<data>AAAWGQ==</data>
<key>device-id</key>
<data>FhkAAA==</data>
</dict>
```

Do not use these any additional boot arguments! Get custom WhateverGreen version instead from Other folder

You can check your screen in gradient test [here](https://www.eizo.be/monitor-test/) or just by simple look at Launchpad background.

<summary><strong>Generate your own SMBIOS</strong></summary>
<br>

[GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)

For the sake of future-proof updates, please use `MacBookAir9,1` (MBA 13 Intel 2020). Otherwise edit USB Map files.

<summary><strong>CPUFriend power management</strong></summary>

Generate CPUFriendDataProvider for your machine [here](https://github.com/fewtarius/CPUFriendFriend) or use at your own risk files provided in the Other folder.

## UEFI modding

It's possible to unlock Advanced menu thus disable CFG Lock natively in UEFI + Other Advanced menu benefits. SPI Programmer CH341a is required

## Repo-specific notes

<details>  

<summary><strong>There are two EFIs in the repo. Which one should I choose? </strong></summary>
<br>

For Thunderbolt support please download the EFI folder. This one is based on [pierpaolodimarzo's EFI config](https://github.com/pierpaolodimarzo/ThinkPad-T480).

For non-Thunderbolt support please download the zip file. This one is based on [valnoxy's EFI config](https://github.com/valnoxy/t480-oc). One notably benefit of using this EFI instead of valnoxy's one is that their config contains a rather long and redundant kext injection list.

Note that the non-TB config is no longer maintained. You will lose TB port DP output as well as 40Gb TB3 support, but you will gain better battery life. Both should boot macOS Sonoma equally well.
